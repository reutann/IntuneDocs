# Prepare line-of-business apps for app protection policies

[!INCLUDE[both-portals](./includes/note-for-both-portals.md)]

You can enable your apps to use app protection policies by using either the Intune App Wrapping Tool or the Intune App SDK. Use this information to learn about these two methods and when to use them.

## Intune App Wrapping Tool
The App Wrapping Tool is used primarily for internal line-of-business (LOB) apps. The tool is a command-line application that creates a wrapper around the app, which then allows the app to be managed by an Intune app protection policy.

You don't need the source code to use the tool, but you do need signing credentials. For more about signing credentials, see the [Intune blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2015/02/25/how-to-obtain-the-prerequisites-for-the-intune-app-wrapping-tool-for-ios/). For the App Wrapping Tool documentation, see [Android App Wrapping Tool ](app-wrapper-prepare-android.md) and [iOS App Wrapping Tool](app-wrapper-prepare-ios.md).

The App Wrapping Tool does **not** support apps in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. It also doesn't support certain features that require developer integration (see the following feature comparison table).


For more information about the App Wrapping Tool for app protection policies on devices that are not enrolled in Intune, see [Protect line-of-business apps and data on devices not enrolled in Microsoft Intune](/intune-classic/deploy-use/protect-line-of-business-apps-and-data-on-devices-not-enrolled-in-microsoft-intune).

### Reasons to use the App Wrapping Tool
* Your app does not have built-in data protection features
* Your app is simple
* Your app is deployed internally
* You don't have access to the app's source code
* You didn't develop the app
* Your app has minimal user authentication experiences


### Supported app development platforms

|**App Wrapping Tool** | **Xamarin** |**Cordova** |
|------|----|----|
|**iOS** |Yes|Yes|
|**Android**| In Preview |Yes|

## Intune App SDK
The App SDK is designed mainly for customers who have apps in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, and want to be able to manage the apps with Intune. However, any app can take advantage of integrating the SDK, even line-of-business apps.

To learn more about the SDK, see the [Overview](app-sdk.md). To get started with the SDK, see [Getting Started With the Microsoft Intune App SDK](app-sdk-get-started.md).

### Reasons to use the SDK
* Your app does not have built-in data protection features
* Your app is complex and contains many experiences
* Your app is deployed on a public app store such as Google Play or Apple's App Store
* You are an app developer and have the technical background to use the SDK
* Your app has other SDK integrations
* Your app is frequently updated

### Supported app development platforms

|**Intune App SDK** |**Xamarin** |**Cordova**
|------|----|----|
|**iOS**|Yes – use the [Intune App SDK Xamarin Bindings](app-sdk-xamarin.md).|Yes – use the [Intune App SDK Cordova Plugin](app-sdk-cordova.md).|
|**Android**| Yes - use the [Intune App SDK Xamarin Bindings](app-sdk-xamarin.md).|Yes – use the [Intune App SDK Cordova Plugin](app-sdk-cordova.md).|

## Feature comparison
This table lists the settings that you can use for the App SDK and App Wrapping Tool.

> [!NOTE]
> The App Wrapping Tool can be used with Intune standalone or Intune with Configuration Manager.
